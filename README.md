NewData is the training dataset

ValidationData are tests with both the traning and validation datasets

Validation_v3_pathogen_only.ipynb remove the host columns and then remove the GO_S column, and uses the training set and the validation set

NewData_XGBoostv2_pathogen_only.ipynb remove the host columns and then remove the GO_S column, and only uses the training set

Validation_v3_host_only.ipynb remove the pathogen columns and then remove the GO_S column, and uses the training set and the validation set
